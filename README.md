This is the code base for the concept presented in
the bachelor thesis written by Leon Forth. 

After downloading the datasets and .. (so running all the
files in the preconfigs folder)
you should be able to run the code (main.py). 
To change the settings (like the batch-size, the clustering method
or the matching) please look into the configs.

The datasets can be found in the datasets folder, all the
helper-files in the utils folder.

For setting up a mamba-environment please have a look at the requirements.txt file.
There you can find all the packages I used in my set-up.
